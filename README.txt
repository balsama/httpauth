Overview
--------

The HTTP Authorization module allows you to prevent unauthorized access to
your Drupal site via HTTP Authentication without touching Apache configuration
files or the .htaccess file. When this module is enabled, visitors will be
required to validate using a valid Drupal account before viewing the site. Note
that this module does not actually log the user in (although the visitor could
log in because they must know valid account credentials to get past the HTTP
Authentication.
